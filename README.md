In this workshop, you will migrate a set of Spring microservices to Azure Spring Cloud. We will be using a modified version of the [Piggy Metrics](https://github.com/sqshq/PiggyMetrics), licensed under MIT license.

## What you should expect

This is not the official documentation but an opinionated training.

It is a hands-on training, and it will use the command line extensively. The idea is to get coding very quickly and play with the platform, from a simple demo to far more complex examples.

After completing all the guides, you should feel confident migrating real-world Spring microservices to Azure Spring Cloud, and implementing a comprehensive and modern DevOps process.
